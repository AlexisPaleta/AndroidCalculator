    //if the user types 100-2%, the user wants that the percentage value is the 2% of 100. This operation happens only when a
    //"-" or "+" is the previous operator. It is necessary to store the previous number at a different variable because when an
    //operator is pressed the current number is just the sign so I will not be able to know of what number I have to obtain
    //the percentage

    //the currentNumber status. But when I press an operator ("+","-") the currentNumber and the previousNumber are updated (the previous until a digit is entered after the sign)
    //and that is OK if all the parenthesis are not closed or there are not parenthesis at all, but if all the parenthesis are correctly closed like (56(7 + 8 x 2))

    //button, this variable add 1 to its value, so all the numbers after that activation will be part of the encapsulatedCurrentNumber, the variable will increment
    //its value with each leftParenthesis Button press and it will be decreased when the rightParenthesisButton is pressed. The add operator function will check
    //the value and if a "x" or "รท" are added to the operation they will always be added to the encapsulatedCurrentNumber. The "+" and "-" need to check
    //the value of sameNumber and if it is zero they will reset the encapsulatedCurrentNumber and add the first element with his sign, if it is not zero then
    //the "+" and "-" will be part of the encapsulatedCurrentNumber. The percentageButton will check the length of encapsulatedCurrentNumber and if is more than
    //maybe 1 then the currentNumber will be replaced with encapsulatedCurrentNumber.
